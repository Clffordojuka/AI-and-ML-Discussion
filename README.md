An introduction discussion  AI in Software Engineering

Here are the answers to quiz questions:

1. **What is TensorFlow, and what are its key features?**  
   TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google for numerical computation and deep learning.  
   **Key features:**  
   - Supports deep learning and traditional ML models  
   - Uses computational graphs for efficient execution  
   - Supports distributed computing  
   - Provides TensorBoard for visualization  
   - Compatible with mobile and edge devices  

2. **What is the main difference between TensorFlow and PyTorch in terms of computation graphs?**  
   - **TensorFlow** uses a **static computation graph** (Graph Mode), requiring explicit definition before execution.  
   - **PyTorch** uses a **dynamic computation graph** (Eager Execution), allowing on-the-fly modifications during runtime.  

3. **What is Keras, and on which frameworks can it run?**  
   Keras is a high-level deep learning API designed for building neural networks easily. It can run on multiple backends, including:  
   - TensorFlow  
   - Theano (deprecated)  
   - Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) (deprecated)  

4. **What are the key features of Scikit-learn?**  
   - Simple and efficient tools for data mining and machine learning  
   - Supports classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction  
   - Built on NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib  
   - Includes feature selection and model evaluation tools  

5. **What is the purpose of Jupyter Notebooks, and what are its key features?**  
   Jupyter Notebooks provide an interactive environment for coding, visualization, and documentation.  
   **Key features:**  
   - Supports multiple programming languages (Python, R, Julia, etc.)  
   - Enables in-line visualization  
   - Allows markdown and code execution in the same document  
   - Useful for data exploration and model prototyping  

6. **In the TensorFlow example provided, what is the purpose of the Dropout layer in the neural network?**  
   The **Dropout** layer helps prevent overfitting by randomly disabling neurons during training, ensuring that the model does not become overly dependent on specific features.  

7. **What is the role of the optimizer in the PyTorch example, and which optimizer is used?**  
   - The optimizer updates model weights to minimize the loss function.  
   - The most commonly used optimizer in PyTorch examples is **Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)**, which efficiently adjusts learning rates.  

8. **In the Keras example, what is the purpose of the Conv2D layer?**  
   The **Conv2D** layer is used in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction by applying convolutional filters to detect edges, textures, and patterns in images.  

9. **What type of model is used in the Scikit-learn example, and what dataset is it applied to?**  
   - The model is likely a **classification or regression model** (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, or Random Forest).  
   - The dataset could be a standard dataset like **Iris, Titanic, or MNIST** (depending on the example).  

10. **What is the output of the Jupyter Notebook example, and which library is used to generate the visualization?**  
    - The output is likely a **graph or plot** representing data trends, model performance, or insights.  
    - The visualization is generated using **Matplotlib or Seaborn** (commonly used for plotting in Jupyter Notebooks).
